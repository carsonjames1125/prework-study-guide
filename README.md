# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this study guide was to teach the basics of coding and get practice doing so, with different techniques and topics. This study guide was created by me for the benefit of familiarizing myself with coding. The problem this guide solved was my knowleddge of coding was very little and after the creation of it, I have learned some of the coding basics and techniques. It was created for bootcamp students going through the prework. It also contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
